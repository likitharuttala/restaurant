**Restaurant Management System**

This project is a web application designed to streamline restaurant operations, including managing menu items, processing orders, and tracking customer interactions. It integrates a PostgreSQL database, Django for backend development, and a responsive frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Key Features:
1. **Database Schema Design (PostgreSQL):**
   - Tables: `products`, `Orders`.
   - Relationships: Ensures data integrity with foreign keys.

2. **Backend Development (Django):**
   - RESTful API: Manages restaurant operations.
   - Models: Defines `products` and `Orders`.
   - Authentication: Secures API endpoints.

3. **Frontend Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):**
   - HTML Templates: For displaying dynamic content.
   - CSS Styling: For responsive and visually appealing design.
   - JavaScript (Optional): Adds interactive features.

4. **Integration:**
   - Seamless interaction between frontend and backend via API calls.
   - Thorough testing ensures cross-browser and device compatibility.

4. **payment gateway integration:**
   Stripe payment gateway is integrated into the application to handle secure online transactions. This allows customers to make payments directly through the platform, 
   ensuring a smooth and secure checkout process.
